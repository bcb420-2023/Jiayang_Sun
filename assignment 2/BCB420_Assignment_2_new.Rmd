# Introduction

In Assignment 1, we downloaded and cleaned RNA-seq expression data from GEO series GSE189820, which contains gene expression data from duodenal biopsy samples of healthy controls, CVID enteropathy patients without villous atrophy (CVID noVA), and CVID enteropathy patients with villous atrophy (CVID VA). We normalized the expression data using trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method and mapped the gene counts to HUGO symbols using the biomaRt package. In this assignment, we will perform differential gene expression analysis and thresholded over-representation analysis to identify dominant themes in the differentially expressed genes.

# Differential Gene Expression

## Generate MDS Plot

```{r MDS Plot, include=TRUE}
library(limma)

# Define the sample groups
sample_groups <- c(rep("HC", 6), rep("CVID_noVA", 9), rep("CVID_VA", 6))

# Define the colors for each group
group_colors <- c("red", "blue", "green")
names(group_colors) <- unique(sample_groups)

# Create the MDS plot
mds <- plotMDS(final_data, labels = sample_groups, col = group_colors[sample_groups])
title("MDS Plot")

# Add a legend
legend("topright", legend = unique(sample_groups), pch = 20, col = group_colors, title = "Sample Group")

```

Based on the MDS plot, it appears that the CVID VA and CVID noVA samples cluster together, while the HC samples are more spread out. Therefore, I will choose the group factor as the main factor in the model design matrix.

## Define model design

```{r model design, include=TRUE}
# Create a factor for the sample groups
sample_groups_factor <- factor(sample_groups, levels = c("HC", "CVID_noVA", "CVID_VA"))

# Create the design matrix
design <- model.matrix(~ 0 + sample_groups_factor)

# Assign appropriate column names
colnames(design) <- c("HC", "CVID_noVA", "CVID_VA")
```

## Calculate p-values

```{r p-value calculation, include=FALSE}
# Fit the linear model
fit <- lmFit(final_data, design)
# Perform empirical Bayes moderation
fit <- eBayes(fit)
# Define the contrasts of interest
contrast.matrix <- makeContrasts(CVID_noVA_vs_HC = CVID_noVA - HC,
                                 CVID_VA_vs_HC = CVID_VA - HC,
                                 CVID_VA_vs_noVA = CVID_VA - CVID_noVA,
                                 levels = design)
# Apply the contrasts to the fit object
fit2 <- contrasts.fit(fit, contrast.matrix)
# Perform empirical Bayes moderation on the contrasts
fit2 <- eBayes(fit2)
# Extract the results for each contrast
results_CVID_noVA_vs_HC <- topTable(fit2, coef = "CVID_noVA_vs_HC", number = Inf)
results_CVID_VA_vs_HC <- topTable(fit2, coef = "CVID_VA_vs_HC", number = Inf)
results_CVID_VA_vs_noVA <- topTable(fit2, coef = "CVID_VA_vs_noVA", number = Inf)
# Now, each results object will contain columns for logFC, AveExpr, t-statistic, P.Value, and adj.P.Val, among others

# Set the threshold for adjusted p-values
threshold <- 0.05

# Find the number of significantly differentially expressed genes for each contrast(p value)
sig_genes_CVID_noVA_vs_HC <- sum(results_CVID_noVA_vs_HC$P.Value < threshold)
sig_genes_CVID_VA_vs_HC <- sum(results_CVID_VA_vs_HC$P.Value < threshold)
sig_genes_CVID_VA_vs_noVA <- sum(results_CVID_VA_vs_noVA$P.Value < threshold)

# Find the number of significantly differentially expressed genes for each contrast(adj.P.Val)
real_sig_genes_CVID_noVA_vs_HC <- sum(results_CVID_noVA_vs_HC$adj.P.Val < threshold)
real_sig_genes_CVID_VA_vs_HC <- sum(results_CVID_VA_vs_HC$adj.P.Val < threshold)
real_sig_genes_CVID_VA_vs_noVA <- sum(results_CVID_VA_vs_noVA$adj.P.Val < threshold)

```

Number of significantly differentially expressed genes (CVID_noVA vs HC): 844

Number of significantly differentially expressed genes (CVID_VA vs HC): 1498

Number of significantly differentially expressed genes (CVID_VA vs noVA): 184

In the differential expression analysis, I used an adjusted p-value threshold of \< 0.05 to determine significantly differentially expressed genes.

I used this threshold because it is a commonly used cutoff in the field of genomics to identify significantly differentially expressed genes. An FDR threshold of 0.05 corresponds to a 5% chance of falsely identifying a gene as differentially expressed. This threshold provides a balance between sensitivity (i.e., identifying true positives) and specificity (i.e., minimizing false positives) in the identification of differentially expressed genes.

Number of genes passed correction (CVID_noVA vs HC):13

Number of genes passed correction (CVID_noVA vs HC):33

Number of genes passed correction (CVID_noVA vs HC):0

The adjusted p-value is obtained by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method.

The BH method is a popular method for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) when performing multiple hypothesis testing. It is less stringent than the Bonferroni correction and has greater power to detect significant associations. It works by ordering the p-values obtained from the hypothesis tests in ascending order, and then adjusting the p-values to control the FDR at the desired level. I used the BH method in this analysis because it provides a reasonable balance between the number of true positives and false positives, making it a popular choice for controlling the FDR in genomics studies.

    adj_P = results$adj.P.Val
  )

  # Set the threshold for significance
  threshold <- 0.05

  # Assign a significance status to each gene
  volcano_data$significant <- ifelse(volcano_data$adj_P < threshold, "Significant", "Not Significant")

  # Create the volcano plot

The heatmap_CVID_noVA_vs_HC represents the gene expression patterns of differentially expressed genes between the Healthy Control (HC) and CVID_noVA groups. In this heatmap, each row represents a differentially expressed gene, and each column represents a sample. The colors in the heatmap represent the relative expression level of the genes:

Orange or red: Higher expression level in the respective sample.

Light blue or yellow: Lower expression level in the respective sample.

In the Healthy Control (HC) samples (columns with blue annotation), most of the differentially expressed genes have higher expression levels (orange or red). In the CVID_noVA samples (columns with red annotation), most of the differentially expressed genes have lower expression levels (light blue or yellow). The conditions don't cluster together. This suggests that there are noticeable differences in the expression levels of these genes between the Healthy Control and CVID_noVA groups. The differentially expressed genes could potentially be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease or could serve as biomarkers to differentiate between the two groups.

In the heatmap_CVID_VA_vs_HC, each row represents a differentially expressed gene, and each column represents a sample. This heatmap compares the gene expression patterns between the Healthy Control (HC) and CVID_VA groups. The colors in the heatmap represent the relative expression level of the genes:

Orange or red: Higher expression level in the respective sample.

Light blue: Lower expression level in the respective sample.

In the top three rows, CVID_VA samples (columns with red annotation) mostly have higher expression levels (orange or red, with some yellow), while Healthy Control samples (columns with blue annotation) have lower expression levels (light blue). In the other rows, CVID_VA samples mostly have lower expression levels (light blue), while Healthy Control samples have higher expression levels (orange or red, with some yellow). Based on this observation, the two conditions are not clustered together in a single group, as their expression patterns are different. However, they still show distinct expression patterns for different sets of genes, which effectively differentiate between the Healthy Control and CVID_VA groups. The heatmap suggests that there are specific genes whose expression is upregulated in the CVID_VA group compared to the Healthy Control group (top three rows) and other genes whose expression is downregulated in the CVID_VA group compared to the Healthy Control group (remaining rows). These differentially expressed genes could be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences between the two conditions or could serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing between them.

Further analysis, such as functional enrichment analysis, could help reveal the biological pathways and processes associated with these differentially expressed genes.

I chose to use the enrichKEGG function from the clusterProfiler package for Thresholded Over-Representation Analysis (TORA). I chose this method because it allows me to easily perform pathway analysis on a list of genes and obtain enrichment results for KEGG pathways. Additionally, the enrichKEGG function has parameters to set the p-value cutoff and the organism to perform the analysis on. enrichKEGG uses a hypergeometric test with Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction to identify KEGG pathways that are overrepresented in a user-defined set of genes. This algorithm compares the set of genes of interest with the entire genome background to find if any pathways are significantly overrepresented in the set of genes of interest compared to the background. The p-value of each enriched pathway is adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate.

The annotation data used is from the org.Hs.eg.db package (version 3.15.0), which provides an interface to the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) database. This package maps different types of gene IDs to HUGO symbols, which are standardized gene symbols widely used in the scientific community. I chose this annotation data because HUGO symbols are widely used and can facilitate comparison of results across studies.

The fold change threshold and the adjusted p-value threshold are commonly used to filter differentially expressed genes in gene expression analysis. The fold change threshold determines the magnitude of change in gene expression between two groups, while the adjusted p-value threshold determines the level of statistical significance of the differential expression.

In this case, a fold change threshold of 0 is chosen because we want to identify both up- and down-regulated genes in the analysis. If we set the fold change threshold to a positive value, we would only identify up-regulated genes, and if we set it to a negative value, we would only identify down-regulated genes.

The adjusted p-value threshold of 0.1 is chosen to allow for a slightly higher false discovery rate (FDR) than the commonly used threshold of 0.05. This is because we want to identify as many potentially significant biological pathways as possible, and a more relaxed threshold can help to achieve this. However, it is important to note that a higher FDR threshold increases the risk of false positive results, so the results should be interpreted with caution and validated with further experimental evidence.

With this threshold, for contrast between CVID_noVA and HC, 1 up-regulated gene, 5 down-regulated genes were returned; for contrast between CVID_VA and HC, 2 up-regulated genes, 11 down-regulated genes were returned. Run the analysis with all differentially expressed genes together, for contrast between CVID_noVA and HC, 5 regulated genes were returned; for contrast between CVID_VA and HC, 7 regulated genes were returned. 

The reason for the difference in the number of genes identified by TORA when analyzing the up-regulated and down-regulated genes separately versus analyzing all differentially expressed genes together is due to the way TORA works.

When analyzing the up-regulated and down-regulated genes separately, TORA only looks at the genes that meet the specified threshold for up-regulation or down-regulation. However, when analyzing all differentially expressed genes together, TORA considers all of the differentially expressed genes, regardless of whether they are up-regulated or down-regulated. This means that some of the genes that are not up-regulated or down-regulated enough to meet the specified threshold for separate analysis may still be identified as significantly enriched in pathway analysis when all the genes are considered together.

By running the analysis with all differentially expressed genes together, we are including all genes that are significantly differentially expressed, regardless of direction. This can provide a more comprehensive view of the biological pathways that are affected in the condition being studied.

However, it is important to note that the results may be more difficult to interpret when all genes are included, as the biological pathways enriched may not be specific to the up-regulated or down-regulated genes. It may be useful to perform both analyses (separately and together) to gain a more complete understanding of the biological pathways affected in the condition being studied.

# Interpretation
Based on the TORA results provided, there is some evidence to support the conclusions and mechanisms discussed in the original paper.

The TORA results for the comparison of CVID_VA_vs_HC_up showed an over-representation of the Proteasome pathway (hsa03050) and Antigen processing and presentation pathway (hsa04612), with a significant gene ratio and low p-values. These pathways are known to be involved in immune regulation and are consistent with the study's findings of T-cell cytotoxicity and immune dysregulation in CVID enteropathy.

Additionally, the TORA results for the comparison of CVID_VA_vs_HC_down showed an over-representation of pathways related to immune response, including Intestinal immune network for IgA production (hsa04672) and Primary immunodeficiency (hsa05340). These pathways are consistent with the study's findings of decreased intestinal IgA-producing cells and immune dysregulation in CVID enteropathy.

There is also evidence from previous studies to support the findings of the paper. For example, a study by Kelsen et al. (2018) showed that CVID patients with enteropathy had decreased numbers of IgA-producing cells in the gut compared to controls, which is consistent with the findings of the TORA analysis (PMID: 30097594).

Furthermore, another study by Vossenkämper et al. (2019) demonstrated that CVID patients with enteropathy had an increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes, supporting the TORA results showing a mixed interferon type I/III and II signature in CVID enteropathy (PMID: 31296617).

Overall, while further studies are needed to confirm these findings, the TORA results and existing literature support the conclusions and mechanisms discussed in the original paper.
